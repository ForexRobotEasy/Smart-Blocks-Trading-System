## Code Description

The Smart Blocks Trading System is an indicator designed to identify and plot order blocks based on market structure. It calculates the block price for each bar and plots it on the chart.

### Indicator Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the indicator. It sets up the indicator buffers, style, and label. It also sets the indicator parameters.

### Indicator Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the indicator is removed from the chart. It cleans up the indicator buffers.

### Indicator Calculation

The `OnCalculate()` function is where the order blocks are calculated. It iterates through each bar and calls the `CalculateBlockPrice()` function to determine the block price. The block price is then assigned to the `buffer_main` array.

### Calculate Block Price

The `CalculateBlockPrice()` function is responsible for calculating the block price based on market structure. It performs necessary calculations and returns the block price.
